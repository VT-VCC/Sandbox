## How to Use Change log

	Please Include your name, the date, and a brief summary of the update
when any notable changes are made to the simulation code or project 
organizational structure. Put updates in order from most recent to 
oldest, top to bottom. Not every GitHub commit requires a change log
entry if it is only a minor bug fix, etc.
